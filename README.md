#Overview
The goal was to use Core Data to create and store a list of 'items' and a list of 'bags,' in which each bag could contain as many of the items as someone felt necessary to put in it.  This functioanlity can be achieved with NSCoding by creating an array to store the custom item objects and then another array that was a property of each individual bag to store arrays of custom item objects.  In Core Data this functionality is achieved by creating a 'to-many' relationship.  In a 'to-many' relationship one call of NSManagedObjects holds an NSSet of pointers to instances of another NSManagedObject class.
